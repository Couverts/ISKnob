ISKnob
======

VB.NET ImageStrip Rotary Knob control

I used KnobMan to make the knob included.

This control was designed as a rotary knob, but it could easily be used for other purposes such as indicator lights or switches. Ofcourse some changes would need to be made.

Currently it is designed to work only with square images...

The knob is used extensively in the Sherman Filterbank Preset Manager I built.
